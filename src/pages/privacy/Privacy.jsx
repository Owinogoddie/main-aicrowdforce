<h2>4. Lawful basis for Personal Data processing</h2>
<p>We consider that the legal bases for using your personal data as set out in this privacy policy are as follows:</p>
<ol >
<li >our use of your personal data is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to comply with our contract to provide services to or receive services from you; or to comply with the terms of use of our website which you accept by browsing our website); or</li>
<li >our use of your personal data is necessary for complying with our legal obligations (for tax or accounting regulations, or for health and safety purposes); or</li>
<li >where neither (a) nor (b) apply, use of your personal data is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to ensure the security of our website). Our legitimate interests are to:
<ol >
<li >run, grow and develop our business (as well as the business of our group companies CloudFactory USA LLC, CloudFactory Holdings Limited, CloudFactory Kenya Limited and Sprout Technology Service Private Limited);</li>
<li >operate our website and its subdomains as referenced above;</li>
<li >select appropriately skilled and qualified suppliers;</li>
<li >carry out marketing, market research and business development;</li>
<li >place, track and ensure fulfilment of orders with our suppliers; and</li>
<li >for internal group administrative purposes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li >If we rely on our (or another person's) legitimate interests for using your personal data, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person's) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal data. You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details in the section "Controlling your personal data".</li>
<li >We may process your personal data in some cases for marketing purposes on the basis of your consent (which you may withdraw at any time after giving it, as described below).</li>
<li >If we rely on your consent for us to use your personal data in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by referring to the CloudFactory confirmation email as sent on subscribing to a service to unsubscribe or update your preferences. Alternatively, you can contact us using the contact details in the section "Controlling your personal data". However, if you withdraw your consent, this would prevent us from providing marketing information to you regarding our products and services.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5. Transfer of personal data to third parties</h2>
<p>We will never sell personal data to third parties. However, we may need to provide personal data we have collected to our group companies, partners, subcontractors, agents and suppliers to enable them to support us in the fulfilment of our contractual obligations or in the ordinary conduct of our business as described in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>We may share your personal data with other companies within the CloudFactory Group for internal administrative purposes (for example, for corporate strategy, compliance, auditing and monitoring, research and development and quality assurance). These companies are CloudFactory USA LLC, CloudFactory Holdings Limited, CloudFactory Kenya Limited and Sprout Technology Service Private Limited, which are based in the United Kingdom, the United States, Kenya and Nepal respectively. As our group grows, we may need to transfer your personal data to new members of our group of companies.</p>
<p>We may share your personal data with the following third parties or categories of third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>cloud computing and back-up services providers who are based in the United States, France, India, Kenya and Nepal; and</li>
<li>service providers who are based in the United States who provide us with cookie data analysis services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any third parties with whom we share your personal data are limited (by law and by contract) in their ability to use your personal data. We will always ensure that any third parties with whom we share your personal data are subject to privacy and security obligations consistent with this privacy policy and applicable laws.</p>
<p>We will also disclose your personal data to third parties:</p>
<ol >
<li >where it is in our legitimate interests to do so to run, grow and develop our business:</li>
<ol >
<li >we may disclose your personal data to any prospective buyer of our business or assets (and their advisers);</li>
<li >if all or relevant parts of our business assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us will be one of the transferred assets;</li>
<li >in some circumstances, to actual or prospective investors in our business (and to their professional advisers);</li>
</ol>
<li >if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, any lawful request from government or law enforcement officials and as may be required to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or prevent illegal activity;</li>
<li >in order to enforce or apply our terms of use, our terms and conditions for customers or any other agreement or to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity; or</li>
<li >to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our staff, our customers or other persons. This may include exchanging personal data with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection.</li>
</ol>
<p>We may also disclose and use anonymised, aggregated reporting and statistics about users of our website or our goods and services for the purpose of internal reporting or reporting to our group or other third parties, and for our marketing and promotion purposes. None of these anonymised, aggregated reports or statistics will enable our users to be personally identified.</p>
<h2>6. Where we may transfer your personal data</h2>
<p>Your personal data may be used, stored and/or accessed by staff operating outside the UK who are working for us, other members of our group, or our suppliers. Further details on to whom your personal data may be disclosed are set out in the section "Transfer of personal data to third parties".</p>
<p>If we provide any personal data about you to any such persons outside of the UK, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal data adequately in accordance with this privacy policy. These measures may include the following:</p>
<ol >
<li >ensuring that there is an adequacy decision by the UK Government in the case of transfers out of the UK, which means that the recipient country is deemed to provide adequate protection for such personal data; or</li>
<li >where we have in place standard model contractual arrangements with the recipient which have been approved by the UK Government. These model contractual clauses include certain safeguards to protect the personal data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further details on the steps we take to protect your personal data in these cases are available from us on request by contacting us by email at privacy@cloudfactory.com at any time.</p>
<h2>7. How long we keep personal data</h2>
<p>As a general rule we keep personal data only for so long as is reasonably necessary bearing in mind our legitimate interests in processing it. In nearly all cases this will be a minimum of six years to enable us to comply with statutory record keeping purposes.</p>
